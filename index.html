        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, lowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br>
              thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br>
               Administration"</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br>
               conservation Corps, helping starving americans. "I saw how food changed<br>
                them", he said. "All of this left scares on me."</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br>
               budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br>
                study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent<br>
                 plants.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Peral Harbor attack, but is<br>
               rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br>
             DDT to control maleria, disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Received a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br>
               pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br>
                program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains<br>
                 of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties of each major<br>
                  climate on earth.</li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
          <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br>
             American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes<br>
              on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the<br>
             Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a<br>
              rapidly expanding population</li>
          <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
          <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br>
             Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the<br>
              demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not<br>
               inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants<br>
                and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people<br>
                 were selecting the best breeds."</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
